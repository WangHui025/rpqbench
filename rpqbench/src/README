=================================


1. Compiling the Source Code 
----------------------------
We provide a Makefile for compiling the project. All you need is a standard installation of build tools such as g++ and make.

To compile from scratch, simply type 

> make

and wait for the executable rpqbench_gen being build.


2. Running the Data Generator 
-----------------------------
For instructions on how to run the data generator and command line options, see the README file at rpqbench/bin/README. 


3. Compile Options
------------------
It is advisable not to use optimization level -O3, as it might affect the integrity of the generated data due to some non-semantics-preserving floating point optimizations at this level.
